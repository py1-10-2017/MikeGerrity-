How I got into programming: I have been working in data analytics for some time. While taking on many different types of projects, I have always been fascinated by the different programming languages and tools other developers used to automate and perform analysis.

My short term goal after completing this course: As I said on my enrollment application, I don't just want to use my computer, I want to make it dance.
So when complete, I plan to install rack mount server in my basement and set it up to perform day to day tasks in the background while I focus on other parts of the business.

Personally, I am an aspiring Pit Master so I would love to enter a BBQ competion in 2018. I have a killer Rib recipe.# MikeGerrity-
